  <h3>Export Product Metafields</h3>
  <p>Directions for Use</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Update the credentials and store URL</li>
    <li>Install any missing modules</li>
    <li>Run file</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Currently this writes to the file specified using ":::" as the line separator. Once the import is completed
    The ":::" needs to be replaced with a "," and a root object needs to be added along with an array that holds all of the       metafields. Future improvement plan is to create this JSON data as a valid file without requiring any modification.
